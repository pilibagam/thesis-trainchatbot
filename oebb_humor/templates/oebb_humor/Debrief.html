    <p class="mb-3">
        Thank you for participating in this study. Our research explores how different
        <strong>chatbot response styles</strong>—with and without humor—shape reactions to
        <strong>service disruptions</strong> in public rail transport.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-3">
        We compare various types of humor and different levels of disruption severity to understand
        how people feel, evaluate, and respond to the chatbot. Your answers help us learn how digital
        assistants can communicate more effectively in stressful travel situations.
